Answer it with answer_branch; your final answer_branch call blocks again as the listener for the next ask. The pending call is the listener: never poll or re-call while one is running, and never claim you are listening unless a blocking call is running. The host may move a blocked call to the background after 120s and deliver its result later as a task notification; that is normal — end your turn with at most one short line and wait.",

It may include thread: lineage markdown this server never sent you; an entry marked omitted was too large to attach, so fetch it with read_rabbithole node_ids if the ask needs it. Empty selected_text means a question about the parent document as a whole. notes are the human's margin notes: on_lineage ones are the text being replied to; others are context, not questions. Answer only with the parent's text in context: if you do not hold it verbatim (after a compaction, a fresh conversation, or a sub-agent's answer), call read_rabbithole with thread_of first.",
